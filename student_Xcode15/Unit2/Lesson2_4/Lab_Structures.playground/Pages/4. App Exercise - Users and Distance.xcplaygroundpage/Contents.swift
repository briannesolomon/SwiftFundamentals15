struct User {
    
}

//:  Create a variable instance of `User` and call it your name. Use the memberwise initializer to pass in information about yourself. Then print out a description of your `User` instance using the instance's properties.


/*:
 In previous app exercises, you've worked with distance in the fitness tracking app example as a simple number. However, distance can be represented using a variety of units of measurement. Create a `Distance` struct that will represent distance in various units of measurement. At a minimum, it should have a `meters` property and a `feet` property. Create a custom initializer corresponding to each property (i.e. if you only have the two properties for meters and feet you will then have two initializers) that will take in a distance in one unit of measurement and assign the correct value to both units of measurements. Hint: *1 meter = 3.28084 feet*.

 - Example: If you use the initializer for meters and pass in a distance of 1600, the initializer should set `meters` to 1600 and `feet` to 5249.344.
 */


//:  Now create an instance of `Distance` called `mile`. Use the initializer for meters to set the distance to 1600. Print out the property for feet and verify that it is equal to 5249.344.


//:  Now create another instance of `Distance` and give it some other distance. Ensure that both properties are set correctly.
