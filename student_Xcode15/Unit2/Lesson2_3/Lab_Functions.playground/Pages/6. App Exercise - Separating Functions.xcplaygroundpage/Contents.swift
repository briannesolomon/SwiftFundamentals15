//:  Now write a function called `pacing` that takes four `Double` arguments called `currentDistance`, `totalDistance`, `currentTime`, and `goalTime`. The function should also return a `String`, which will be the message to show the user. The function should call `calculatePace`, passing in the appropriate values, and capture the return value. The function should then compare the returned value to `goalTime` and if the user is on pace return "Keep it up!", and return "You've got to push it just a bit harder!" otherwise. Call the function and print the return value.
func pacing(currentDistance: Double, totalDistance: Double, currentTime: Double, goalTime: Double) -> String{
    let requiredPace = goalTime / totalDistance
    let currentPace = calculatePace(currentDistance: currentDistance, totalDistance: totalDistance, currentTime: currentTime)
    
    if currentPace <= requiredPace {
        return "Keep it up!"
    }
    else {
        return "You've got to push it just a bit harder!"
    }
}
pacing(currentDistance: 2.1, totalDistance: 3, currentTime: 85, goalTime: 120)
